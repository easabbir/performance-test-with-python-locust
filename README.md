Step-2: Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8089 to access the Locust web interface, where you can start and control the test.

    1. terminal/cmd/bash -> locust -r 10 -u 3 --host=base_url
    2. go to browsers url -> http://localhost:8089/ -> start/advance options to add test duration 
    3. Click start.

### locust command Explanation:
For Example:

`locust -r 10 -u 100 --host=base_url`

 Details:

`-r: The hatch rate, which is the number of users hatching per second.` 

In this example, it's set to 10.

`-u: The total number of users to simulate during the test. In this example, it's set to 100`

### Tasks
Create a list of user in the application and add those users info in the `resouces>users`
csv file in the below format.

username,password

admin,password123

easabbir,Abbl_234
